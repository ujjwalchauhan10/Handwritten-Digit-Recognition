# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Introduction

Overview :

Handwritten Digit Recognition project is to take a picture of a digit and process it up to recognize the image of that character just like a human brain recognize the various digits. In this project we the MNIST dataset to implement our handwritten digit recognition model. We use a special type of deep neural network known as Convolutional Neural Network. Towards the end of our project, we generate a Confusion Matrix to demonstrate the limitations of the model 

Problem Statement:

Handwritten digit recognition to recognize digit present in the grayscale image of size 28 x 28 pixels.


MNIST Dataset

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a database of handwritten digits and has 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The database is used for testing and training in the field of machine learning. It was made by remixing the samples from NIST's original datasets. The black and white images from NIST were normalized to grayscale images of 28x28 pixel.



Pre-requits :


Before proceeding with Handwritten Digit Recognition, we are required to have knowledge about basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. A prior knowledge of programming language which can be used to implement ML, preferably python. We also need to visualize the steps required in creating and awareness of all libraries that we are going to use.


Theory :

For the Handwritten Digit Recognition, we use a Convolutional Neural Network and the python libraries and tools to implement it are:

1.	Jupyter Lab: It is a web-based environment that allows users to arrange and configure workflow in data science.
2.	tenserflow: It can be used in numerous programming languages; it is a free open source library for artificial intelligence and machine learning with primary focus on deep neural networks.
3.	Matplotlib: It is a multiplatform library used for data visualization; in Python we use it for 2D plots of arrays.
4.	numpy: It is a package for scientific computing in Python. Using numpy we can perform various mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
5.	seaborn: It is Python library for data visualization based on matplotlib. It is used for drawing attractive and information statistical graphics.

Methodology :


The Methodology followed to create the modal is as follows:

1.Importing Necessary libraries 

2.Splitting the MNIST dataset for Training and Testing

3.Preprocessing of data
 
4.Model Training

5.Model Testing

6.Visualizing the Errors 
 
Applications :

1.	Detecting number plates
2.	Reading cheque sequences in banks
3.	Postal mail sorting
4.	Data entry form

Conclusion :

Machine learning is an approach to get the real-life data into the action over human analysis. This project has an aim to achieve that much goal because all machine learning algorithms intends to go to the better way than a human.

In this project we learn and implement Convolutional Neural Network to build a model to recognize handwritten digits and we explore the limitations and challenges that occur while building a model of this kind.
